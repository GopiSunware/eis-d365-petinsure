    "reasoning": "## Silver Layer Enrichment Analysis\n\n### Enrichment Summary\nSuccessfully enriched claim CLM-SCN-001-F9E7 with comprehensive policy, customer, pet, and provider data. The enrichment process revealed several important insights and one critical coverage issue.\n\n### Key Findings\n\n**\u2705 POSITIVE INDICATORS:**\n- Customer is established (member since 2023-01-01) with standard risk tier\n- Provider is highly rated (4.97/5) with low fraud rate (1.5%)\n- Claim amount ($1,355) is reasonable for emergency chocolate toxicity treatment\n- All waiting periods satisfied and within annual limits\n- Treatment appears medically appropriate for theobromine toxicity\n\n**\u26a0\ufe0f CRITICAL COVERAGE ISSUE:**\n- Diagnosis code T65.8 categorized as \"general/unclassified\" which is NOT COVERED under comprehensive plan\n- This appears to be a normalization error - chocolate toxicity should be covered as an accident/poisoning\n\n**\ud83d\udcca CUSTOMER PROFILE:**\n- Lifetime value: $2,000\n- Total claims: 5 (including historical)\n- Average claim: $824.61 vs this claim $1,355\n- Low churn risk (24.8%)\n\n**\ud83c\udfe5 PROVIDER ANALYSIS:**\n- Discrepancy noted: Bronze data shows out-of-network, enrichment shows in-network\n- Provider processes 44 claims with average $1,018 (this claim 33% higher but reasonable for emergency)\n\n### Recommendations\n1. **URGENT**: Review diagnosis code categorization - T65.8 (theobromine toxicity) should be covered as accident/poisoning\n2. Verify provider network status discrepancy\n3. Consider manual review due to coverage categorization issue\n4. Treatment and costs appear legitimate for emergency chocolate toxicity case",
