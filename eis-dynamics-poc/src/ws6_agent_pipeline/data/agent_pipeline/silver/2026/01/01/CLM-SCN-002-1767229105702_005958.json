    "reasoning": "## Silver Layer Enrichment Analysis\n\n### Critical Issues Identified:\n1. **TEMPORAL ANOMALY**: Submission date (2026-01-01) is 13+ months in the future from treatment date (2024-12-15) - this confirms the Bronze layer quarantine decision\n2. **COVERAGE DENIAL**: Diagnosis category 'general' is not covered under comprehensive plan despite claim being for accident\n3. **HIGH CLAIM AMOUNT**: $5,935 is significantly higher than provider's average claim amount of $663\n\n### Enrichment Summary:\n- **Policy**: Active comprehensive coverage with $250 deductible, 80% reimbursement rate\n- **Customer**: Standard risk tier, low churn risk (14.7%), only 1 previous claim\n- **Pet**: 4-year-old mixed breed dog, no known pre-existing conditions\n- **Provider**: Out-of-network specialist surgical center with good rating (4.26) and low fraud rate (1.75%)\n\n### Business Rules Validation:\n- Waiting period satisfied (349 days)\n- Within annual limit ($10,000)\n- Would calculate to $4,548 reimbursement if covered\n- However, DENIED due to diagnosis categorization issue\n\n### Recommendation:\nMaintain QUARANTINE status for human review to address:\n1. Date discrepancy investigation\n2. Diagnosis code categorization review (S83.5 should likely be orthopedic/accident, not general)\n3. Verify legitimacy of high-cost TPLO surgery claim",
