    "reasoning": "## Silver Layer Enrichment Analysis for CLM-SCN-001-1767117534410\n\n### Enrichment Summary\nSuccessfully enriched claim with comprehensive data from all required sources:\n- **Policy**: Active comprehensive coverage with $250 deductible, $10K annual limit, 80% reimbursement\n- **Customer**: Standard risk tier customer since 2023, moderate lifetime value ($2K), low churn risk (13%)\n- **Pet**: 4-year-old mixed breed dog, 45 lbs, no known pre-existing conditions\n- **Provider**: In-network emergency hospital with excellent rating (4.74/5), low fraud rate (3.2%)\n\n### Key Findings & Concerns\n\n#### \u26a0\ufe0f CRITICAL COVERAGE ISSUE\n**Claim will be DENIED** - The diagnosis code T65.8 (theobromine toxicity) was categorized as \"general/unclassified\" which is NOT covered under the comprehensive plan. This appears to be a normalization issue as chocolate toxicity should clearly be covered as an accident.\n\n#### Positive Indicators\n- Customer has good payment history and relationship\n- Provider is reputable and in-network\n- Claim amount ($1,355) is reasonable for emergency toxicity treatment\n- All policy requirements met (waiting period, limits)\n\n#### Data Quality Concerns\n- Pet name shows as \"Unknown Pet\" - incomplete enrichment\n- Diagnosis normalization may be incorrect (should be accident/toxicity, not general)\n- Late submission (claim from Dec 2024, submitted Dec 2025) needs investigation\n\n### Recommendations\n1. **URGENT**: Review diagnosis code mapping - T65.8 should map to accident/toxicity category\n2. Investigate the 1-year delay in claim submission\n3. Consider manual review given the coverage categorization discrepancy\n4. Update pet information to complete the record\n\n### Quality Assessment\n- Enrichment Completeness: 100%\n- Data Confidence: 71% (reduced due to normalization concerns)\n- Overall Silver Score: 83%",
