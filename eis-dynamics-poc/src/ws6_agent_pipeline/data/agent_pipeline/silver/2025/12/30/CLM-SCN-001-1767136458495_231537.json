    "reasoning": "## Silver Layer Enrichment Analysis\n\n**CRITICAL COVERAGE ISSUE IDENTIFIED**: This claim will be DENIED due to coverage exclusion.\n\n### Enrichment Summary:\n- **Policy**: Comprehensive coverage with $250 deductible, 80% reimbursement, $10K annual limit\n- **Customer**: Standard risk tier, 2-year member with moderate claim history (4 previous claims totaling $5,541)\n- **Pet**: 4-year-old mixed breed dog, 45 lbs, no known pre-existing conditions\n- **Provider**: In-network emergency hospital with excellent rating (4.66/5) and low fraud rate (3.5%)\n\n### Key Concerns:\n1. **COVERAGE DENIAL**: Diagnosis code T65.8 falls under \"general\" category which is NOT covered under comprehensive plans\n2. **Claim Amount Anomaly**: $1,355 is significantly higher than provider's average ($521), suggesting potential emergency premium\n3. **Submission Delay**: 375-day delay between treatment (2024-12-20) and submission (2025-12-30) raises questions\n\n### Business Rules Results:\n- \u274c **NOT COVERED**: General category excluded from comprehensive coverage\n- \u2705 Waiting period satisfied (354 days > 14 required)\n- \u2705 Within annual limits ($1,355 < $10,000 remaining)\n- \u2705 Provider is in-network\n- \u2705 Would calculate to $884 reimbursement if covered (after $250 deductible)\n\n### Quality Assessment:\n- Enrichment Completeness: 100%\n- Data Confidence: 71% (reduced due to synthetic data)\n- Overall Silver Score: 83%\n\n**RECOMMENDATION**: DENY claim due to coverage exclusion, but maintain customer relationship given their loyalty and standard risk profile.",
