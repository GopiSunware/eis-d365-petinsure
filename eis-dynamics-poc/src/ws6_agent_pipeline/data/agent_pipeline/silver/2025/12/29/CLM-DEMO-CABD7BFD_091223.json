    "reasoning": "## Silver Layer Enrichment Analysis for CLM-DEMO-CABD7BFD\n\n### Enrichment Summary\nSuccessfully enriched claim with complete policy, customer, pet, and provider data. All lookups returned valid information with 100% completeness.\n\n### Key Findings:\n1. **Customer Profile**: John Smith is a loyal customer (member since 2020) with standard risk tier and low churn risk (15%)\n2. **Pet Information**: Max is a 5-year-old Golden Retriever with known hip dysplasia risk\n3. **Provider**: City Pet Hospital is in-network with excellent rating (4.5/5) and low fraud rate (2%)\n4. **Policy**: Comprehensive coverage with $250 deductible and 80% reimbursement rate\n\n### Critical Coverage Issue:\n**CLAIM NOT COVERED** - The wellness exam falls under 'general' category which is excluded from the comprehensive plan. This is unusual as most comprehensive plans include wellness coverage.\n\n### Anomalies Detected:\n1. **Claim Amount Discrepancy**: $150 is significantly lower than provider's average ($850) and customer's historical average ($1,324)\n2. **Policy Expiration**: Policy expires 2024-12-31 but treatment date is 2025-12-29 - potential coverage gap\n3. **Unusual Coverage Gap**: Wellness exams typically covered under comprehensive plans\n\n### Recommendation:\nReview policy terms for wellness coverage and verify treatment date accuracy. Consider customer retention given their high lifetime value ($4,500) and this coverage denial.",
