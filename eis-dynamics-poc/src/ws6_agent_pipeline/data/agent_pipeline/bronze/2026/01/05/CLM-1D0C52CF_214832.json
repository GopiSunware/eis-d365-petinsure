    "reasoning": "This claim represents a legitimate emergency veterinary case for gastric foreign body removal. All required fields are present and valid. The claim amount of $5,000 is mathematically accurate (sum of line items) and clinically reasonable for emergency surgery including exploratory laparotomy and gastrotomy. The treatment notes are detailed and consistent with the diagnosis code T18.9. While external services were unavailable for policy/provider verification, the data structure and content quality are sufficient for Bronze layer acceptance. The only minor concern is the round claim amount, but this is explained by the nature of emergency surgical procedures. Data quality score of 89.1% exceeds acceptance threshold.",
