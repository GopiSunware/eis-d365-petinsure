    "reasoning": "Claim CLM-2F69FFDA passed all technical validation checks with high data quality (89.1% overall score). Schema validation passed with all required fields present. No anomalies were detected by the automated system. However, manual review of historical claims revealed a potential duplicate claim (CLM-778335A8) with identical diagnosis code, treatment notes, line items, amounts, service date, and provider. While the claim data itself appears legitimate for a superficial laceration treatment with appropriate costs ($155 total), the existence of what appears to be a duplicate submission requires human investigation to determine if this is a system error, legitimate resubmission, or potential fraud attempt. The claim is being quarantined for manual review rather than automatic processing.",
