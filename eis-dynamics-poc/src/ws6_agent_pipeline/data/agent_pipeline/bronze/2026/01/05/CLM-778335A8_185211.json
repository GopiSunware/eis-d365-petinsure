No anomalies were detected, indicating normal claim patterns. Data cleaning made minimal changes (claim_type normalization). Quality assessment shows 89.1% overall score with perfect accuracy and consistency. The claim amount matches line item totals exactly, treatment details align with diagnosis, and costs are reasonable for superficial laceration treatment. While some optional fields are missing and external service validations were unavailable, the core claim data integrity is excellent with no fraud indicators.",
