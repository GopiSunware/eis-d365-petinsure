While the clinical details and claim amount are consistent with routine vaccination services, several factors elevate the risk score: 1) Multiple existing claims with unknown/incomplete data make historical pattern analysis impossible, 2) Missing provider information prevents verification of legitimacy, 3) The diagnosis code Z23 is appropriate for immunization encounters, 4) The $95 claim amount is reasonable for FVRCP vaccination plus examination, 5) Same-day submission suggests prompt filing but could indicate automation. The claim appears clinically legitimate but lacks sufficient verification data for auto-approval.",

    "reasoning": "This claim requires QUARANTINE due to several critical data verification issues: 1) Policy verification failed - unable to confirm POL-DEMO-003 exists or is active, 2) Provider verification failed - 'Unknown' provider cannot be validated, 3) Missing diagnosis code - empty diagnosis_code field prevents proper medical validation, 4) Missing line items - no detailed breakdown of services provided. While the claim passes basic schema validation and shows no statistical anomalies, these missing verification elements prevent auto-approval. The claim amount ($95) appears reasonable for immunization services, and the treatment notes suggest clinical legitimacy, but insufficient verification data requires manual review.",
