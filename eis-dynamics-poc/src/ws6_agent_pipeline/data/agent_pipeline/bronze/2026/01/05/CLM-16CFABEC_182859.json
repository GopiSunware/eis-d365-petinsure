The claim amount of $2,665 is reasonable for an emergency urinary obstruction case requiring catheterization and hospitalization. Line items are detailed and consistent with the diagnosis and treatment notes. No anomalies were detected in the data patterns. Data cleaning normalized the claim_type field. Quality assessment shows good overall score (89%) with high accuracy and consistency. While some optional fields are missing, this doesn't impact the core claim processing. The claim represents a legitimate emergency veterinary case with appropriate treatment and costs.",
