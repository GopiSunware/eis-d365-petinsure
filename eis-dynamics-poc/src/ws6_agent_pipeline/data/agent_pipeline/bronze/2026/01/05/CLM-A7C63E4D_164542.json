    "reasoning": "Claim CLM-A7C63E4D represents a high-quality neurological claim for idiopathic epilepsy in a dog named Max. The claim passed schema validation with all required fields present. Data quality is excellent at 89.1% overall score. The medical treatment is clinically appropriate - comprehensive neurological workup including MRI, CSF analysis, and bloodwork for new-onset seizures, followed by appropriate anti-epileptic medication (Phenobarbital). The $3,400 total cost is reasonable for this type of specialized neurological care. Only minor concerns include inability to verify external references due to API connectivity issues and a slightly round claim amount, but these do not indicate fraud or data quality issues. The claim shows no anomalous patterns and represents the customer's first claim. Minor data cleaning was performed to normalize the claim type field.",
