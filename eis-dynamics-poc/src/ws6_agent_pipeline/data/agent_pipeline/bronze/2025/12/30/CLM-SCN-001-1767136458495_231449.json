    "reasoning": "This claim demonstrates excellent data quality across all validation dimensions. Schema validation passed completely with all required fields present and correctly typed. No anomalies were detected - the claim represents a legitimate pet emergency (chocolate toxicity) with appropriate diagnosis coding T65.8 and reasonable emergency treatment costs of $1,355. Data cleaning required only minor normalizations (claim_type standardization and amount conversion to float). Quality assessment shows perfect scores across completeness, accuracy, and consistency metrics. The claim is ready for Silver layer processing.",
