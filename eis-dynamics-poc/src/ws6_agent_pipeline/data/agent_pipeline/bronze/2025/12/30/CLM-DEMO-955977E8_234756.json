No anomalies were detected - the claim amount of $150 for an annual wellness exam is reasonable and typical. The data required no cleaning or normalization. Quality assessment shows perfect scores (1.0) for completeness, accuracy, and consistency. The diagnosis code Z00.0 is appropriate for a wellness exam, and the treatment and submission dates are the same, indicating prompt submission. All data appears legitimate and ready for Silver layer processing.",
