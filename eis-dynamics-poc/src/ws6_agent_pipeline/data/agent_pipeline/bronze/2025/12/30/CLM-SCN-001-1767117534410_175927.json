    "reasoning": "This claim passes all validation checks with excellent data quality. Schema validation confirmed all required fields are present and properly typed. No anomalies were detected - the claim amount ($1,355) is reasonable for emergency veterinary treatment, the diagnosis code T65.8 appropriately matches theobromine toxicity, and the timeline is logical. Data cleaning made only minor normalizations (claim_type standardization and amount conversion to float). Quality assessment shows perfect scores across completeness, accuracy, and consistency metrics. The claim represents a legitimate emergency treatment scenario with complete, accurate documentation.",
