    "reasoning": "The claim data passed all internal validation checks with perfect quality scores (100% completeness, accuracy, and consistency). Schema validation confirmed all required fields are present and correctly typed. No anomalies were detected. Data cleaning applied minor normalizations. However, external validation services (policy verification, provider verification, diagnosis code validation) were unavailable due to connection issues. While the claim appears legitimate (chocolate toxicity is common in pets, treatment notes are appropriate, claim amount is reasonable), I cannot verify critical dependencies like policy status and provider validity. Therefore, quarantining for manual review to ensure complete validation before Silver layer processing.",
