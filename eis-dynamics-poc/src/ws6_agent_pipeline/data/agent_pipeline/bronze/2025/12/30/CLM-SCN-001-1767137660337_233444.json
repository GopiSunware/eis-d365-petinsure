    "reasoning": "This claim passes all validation checks with excellent data quality. Schema validation confirmed all required fields are present and correctly typed. No anomalies were detected - no duplicates, unusual amounts, or suspicious patterns. Data cleaning made only minor normalizations (claim_type to lowercase, amount to float). Quality assessment shows perfect scores (1.0) for completeness, accuracy, and consistency. The claim represents a legitimate accident case (chocolate toxicity) with appropriate diagnosis code T65.8, reasonable treatment amount of $1,355, and valid dates. All data appears consistent and ready for Silver layer processing.",
